             <li>What is Single Page Application or SPA? Explain the difference between SPA and MPA</li>
             <li>in terms of speed and performance SPA no reloading is needed that is equal to high speed and responsivenss</li>
             <li>MPA which is having slow speed and performanceis affected by reloading</li>
             <li>according to coding reusable code for SPA</li>
             <li>MPA needs to coding from scratch</li>
             <li>according to maintenance SPA is fast and easy maintenance</li>
             <li>for MPA maintenance required for each page</li>
             <li>accordingto SEO SPA is having limited optimization</li>
             <li>according to user experience SPA is very smooth and friendly</li>
             <li>MPA user experienceis bad</li>
             <li>there is no loading time required for SPA</li>
             <li>SPA secures only endpoints</li>
             <li>MPA secures end to end </li>
         </ul>
         <ul>
             <li>Differentiate between states and props.</li>
             <li>stat changes can be asynchronous</li>
             <li>props can be readonly</li>
             <li>props can be accessed by child components</li>
             <li>stat cant be accessed by child components</li>
             <li>props are used to communication between components</li>
             <li>stats can be used to change render dynamic chnages within the component</li>
             <li>props are immutable</li>
             <li>stats is mutable</li>
             <li>props are external and controls by Whatever render the component</li>
             <li>stat is internal and controls by react component itself</li>
         </ul>
         <ul>
             <li>Explain props drilling concept and state uplifting</li>
             <li>props drilling is a basically a situation in the same data is been sent to sent it almost every due to the requirement in the final level</li>
             <li>when we have to share the same data across multiple child components then define the data into the parent            </li>
             <li>every component in react has its own state because of These sometimes data can be reabundant and inconsistent so by liftingup the state of the parent component as a singlesource of the truth and pass the data of the children in its parent  </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>What do you know about controlled and uncontrolled components?</li>
                <li>In the React component data is controlledby the React component or parent component</li>
                <li>in the uncontrolled componentdata is controlledby DOM itself</li>
                <li>control components allows validation control</li>
                <li>uncontrolled component doesn't allow validation control</li>
                <li>in control component it has better control over the forms and data</li>
                <li>in uncontrolled component limit control over the forms and data</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>What is React Router?</li>
                <li>react router is a standard library for routing in react it enable the navigation among the views of various components in react application.it allow changing the browser URL</li>
                <li>react router plays an important role to display multiple views in a SPA</li>
